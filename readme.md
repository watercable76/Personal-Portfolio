## Layout  

This portfolio will cover various topics with JS and HTML, with a higher focus on mobile development. The folder  
system will look like this:  

```bash
C:.
├───index.html
├───node_modules
├───scripts
├───css
├───scss
├───week01
├───week02
└───week03

```  

The index.html file

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Development and Tools  

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code to write and debug my project. I am using GitHub Pages to  
produce and display the work that is being done.  

This is all done in vanilla JS and HTML, with some scss added. To run and install scss tools, do the following:  

* Run __npm install sass__ 
* To convert scss to css, run __sass main.scss main.css__. The first file is the one you want to convert, and  
the second file is the name you want to give to your new file  
* If your files are in a different directory, specify the directory path with the filename  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

To access your folder structure like the one listed above, type *__tree__* in your terminal. This will print  
the folder structure to your terminal where you can copy it and use it in the future.
