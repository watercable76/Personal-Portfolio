            <h2>Mobile Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Less people have to think about, happier the user will be</li>
                <li>0 steps > 5 steps</li>
                <li>
                    Teacher showed a diagram of the easier parts to reach with just the user's thumbs, and it clearly
                    defines the length and reach of the user. It puts into perspective the importance of good placement
                    and makes a
                    UX designer really think about every thing that a user will have to do in order to get to their
                    desired place.

                    Loading speed also greatly impacts users and revenues for business based on how fast the apps
                    load on time * Optimize and minifying JS and CSS will make it quicker for a page to load
                </li>

            <h2>Primary Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>FB moved the nav bar for mobile to the bottom to make it easier for users to get to it.</li>
                <li>
                    The hamburger menu is not recognized by a lot of people. Using the word menu as a button will
                    increase in usage
                </li>

            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Removing labels from outside of the forms and putting placeholder text makes it easier for users to
                    understand what's going on
                </li>
                <li>Larger buttons are better since they can be clicked much more easily.</li>
                <li>Multiple pages vs. one huge page of form is a better flow (add a progress bar)</li>
                <li>Says to show password by default (I don't like this)</li>
                <li>Credit card form has simple icons that show what the user has entered (ex. mastercard)</li>
                <li>Make specific keyboards enter first. Numberpad for number solutions, other for everything else</li>
                <li>Link phone numbers to make calling easier for users</li>

            <h2>Mobile Advertising</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We all hate pop-ups :)</li>
                <li>Video ads result in higher conversion rates</li>
                <li>Ad is in the background and can be seen when sliding page</li>
                <li>Users don't go to websites to see ads (make them clean and precise)</li>
