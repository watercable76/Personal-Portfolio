## Mobile Design

Starting with 

Less people have to think about, happier the user will be  

0 steps > 5 steps  

Teacher showed a diagram of the easier parts to reach with just the user's thumbs, and it clearly defines  
the length and reach of the user. It puts into perspective the importance of good placement and makes a UX  
designer really think about every thing that a user will have to do in order to get to their desired place.  

They then showed more diagrams with other devices.

Loading speed also greatly impacts users and revenues for business based on how fast the apps  
load on time. 
* Optimize and minifying JS and CSS will make it quicker for a page to load  

## Primary Controls  

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

FB moved the nav bar for mobile to the bottom to make it easier for users to get to it

The hamburger menu is not recognized by a lot of people. Using the word menu as a button will increase in usage  


## Forms  

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

Removing labels from outside of the forms and putting placeholder text makes it easier for users to understand what's going on
Larger buttons are better since they can be clicked much more easily.  
Multiple pages vs. one huge page of form is a better flow (add a progress bar)
Enable autofill too
Says to show password by default (I don't like this)  
Credit card form has simple icons that show what the user has entered (ex. mastercard)  

Make specific keyboards enter first. Numberpad for number solutions, other for everything else  
Link phone numbers to make calling easier for users  

## Mobile Advertising  

<p>&nbsp;</p>  

We all hate pop-ups :)  
Video ads result in higher conversion rates  
Ad is in the background and can be seen when sliding page  
Users don't go to websites to see ads (make them clean and precise)
