            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Forms are the principal way to gather data or input from users, and then do something. We can verify types of input through a 
                variety of methods. We can verify with JS as users input, when they submit, or even with the backend data control that ensures 
                data is up to standard. It depends on company standards and what the architects and UI/UX designers decide on.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can set inputs to be red, either outlined or filled, and not allow people to submit or go on until the user inputs the correct data. 
                The benefit of this is the user knows there is an issue with their input before they continue. For example, entering the wrong email
                for an account will bring up an error message on the page, clear the input and then allow the user to input their email again.
            </p>

            <h2>Fetch</h2>
            <p>
                Fetch will do two things: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Get data from the website provided and return a promise</li>
                    <li>As soon as the server responds with headers, the promise will be ok, and data returned</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting this data will allow applications to display it in pretty format to users. If I wanted to query all of the weather
                data in the area and show it to users, I could do that. The important thing is taking the data, formatting it to be what is needed,
                and then outputting it to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a developer, the way to do this is as follow.
                <ol>
                    <li>Fetch the data, and use a .then() to return the data into a new data set.</li>
                    <li>With the data set, put data into a model or formatter to make it to what is needed</li>
                    <li>Return data set and set data into page</li>
                </ol>

                This could look like this: 
            </p>
            <pre>var data = fetch(url)
            .then(result => result.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data))</pre>
        </div>
    </main>
</body>
