            <h2>DOM</h2>
            <p>
                The DOM is the Document Object Model, and is the way in which JS interacts with the web page. One thing is cookies
                that can be set and used. Cookies store data, which can store users, sessions, and even gather analytical data.
                Setting user data in a cookie can be easy, and the developer can set when the cookie will expire.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when logging into a website, there will be a time limit, and after that time limit, the user will have to
                log in again. A timestamp is set, and then after it hits the designated time in the future, the cookie expires, and 
                the site will prompt the user to log in again.
            </p>

            <h2>HTML API's</h2>
            <p>
                Web storage is now available for HTML, and can be accessed through Localstorage. Data can be stored, retrieved, and even cleared.
                This is useful for storing data on the page itself without depending on db's or external data storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Websockets are also now supported. This allows sites to get data even when requests are not made. In a chat application, data 
                is pushed to all sources as soon as data is sent. For example, user1 sends a message, and then 4 more. User1 has all of that data,
                and so does user2. The websocket administers the data, ensuring all sources have updated data at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of built-in API's has increased over the years. This means more data manipulation and work is becoming more
                available. More and more features are being added, increasing the power of websites and the work that developers can do.

            <h2>NPM and Modern Projects</h2>
            <p>
                NPM allows devs to create projects and manage them. They essentially create a large project that can be administered, either
                through scripts that are written or even through other projects. For example, npm is a node project, and will include packages
                and files to run the project as a whole. I can host a node.js project, frontend and backend, with npm.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can install more packages which will increase productivity and capabilities. People create packgages for many purposes,
                like unit testing, web sockets, scss compilers, and more. There is so much that npm can do, in addition to creating projects 
                for web sites, desktop applications, and even hosting complete servers.
