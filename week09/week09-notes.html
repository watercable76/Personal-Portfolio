            <h2>DOM</h2>
            <p>
                The DOM is the Document Object Model, and is the way in which JS interacts with the web page. One thing is cookies
                that can be set and used. Cookies store data, which can store users, sessions, and even gather analytical data.
                Setting user data in a cookie can be easy, and the developer can set when the cookie will expire.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when logging into a website, there will be a time limit, and after that time limit, the user will have to
                log in again. A timestamp is set, and then after it hits the designated time in the future, the cookie expires, and 
                the site will prompt the user to log in again.

            <h2>Recursion Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Functions that call themselves inside of their function declarations. You can go through a BST to access data quicker and 
                perform equations at O(log n) speed. This performance is incredible and can speed up operations and make code more 
                efficient.
            </p>

        <div class="notes">
            <h2>Promises</h2>
            <p>
                Promises are chained function calls that can be very long. For example, getting data from MongoDB requires a few things.
                First, the user credentials must be met, and a connection must be made. Then, the user can query for the data they want,
                like getting a list of users that are stored. Then, you can return that data in a callback and either store it or keep
                it in the file you are calling it from.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">
            <h2>Ajax</h2>
            <p>
                API work includes calling data, and then returning a data set. Data can be modeled, and when the data is returned,
                it will be passed into that model. The developer can set parameters, certain data flow, and so forth. The important
                thing is the data is returned, either with a promise or with exceptions, and then the data is used in the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case with MongoDB, the user queries for something, and a data set is returned. The data is sent to the page,
                and the page is filled with content. This is an example of the API work that occurs in the backend of a project.
