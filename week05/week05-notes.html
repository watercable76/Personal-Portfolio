            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging can be done with a variety of sources. You can use console.log(),
                developer tools, and even built-in JS methods to help with debugging.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal favorite is using console.log() in order to find out what
                data is being used and what is being output.

            <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
            <p>
                One great tool is exception handling. This is used to check for events which will be an exception,
                like handling input from the user as a float, but they input a long instead. This may cause issues
                and we can find ways to take care of this. Using a try-catch will allow the program to attempt an
                operation, but will catch any issue and give that to us so we can manipulate it at that moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, we can try to convert data from one type to another, and instead of the code catching,
                we will throw an exception which will handle that bad data. Converting 'hello_World' to a float 
                will not break the code, but an error can be thrown to the screen so the user understands
                their input needs to be a numeric value.

            <h2>Test Driven Development</h2>
            <p>
                Writing code and writing tests for that code will make the deployment process much quicker
                than just writing code. CICD is Continuous Integration - Continuous Development. This refers to 
                the way code is developed and deployed. Code that is always tested as it is written allows the 
                developers to find and remove bugs in their code quicker. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if I am deploying to GitHub, and I want to verify that my code is functional
                before deploying it, there are some tests I can write to check for this. This will allow the
                project to always be compiling before accepting new changes, which will ensure code is at least
                somewhat functional before the code is running on production level.
